Workshop materials for Practical computing and analysis for the biomedical researcher bootcamp 

Day4: Utilizing R to visualize and analyze data

This session will build on basic skills to explore best practices in exploratory data analysis using ggplot2, R’s most prominent plotting package. In addition, we will investigate relationships between variables using classic statistical techniques. Participants will engage in active learning with instructor-led tutorials and problem sets that tackle real-world data analysis exercises.

All teaching materials were developed by [Data Services at the Health Sciences Library](https://data.hsl.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.
